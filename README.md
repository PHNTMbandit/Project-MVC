Project MVC

A simple 3D action game built in 2 weeks with an expandable player controller and a dynamic enemy AI system. As the player you must survive against waves of enemies by using your magic projectiles.

Featuring a player selection screen and player state machine, this projects highlights my ability to rapidly create a fun and engaging game built upon a reliable and solid codebase with room for expandability and modification.
