# Project MVC

Project MVC is an exhilarating action-packed 3D game designed to showcase my proficiency in Unity game development. Immerse yourself in a dynamic battlefield where waves of enemies relentlessly challenge your skills. The game features a sophisticated enemy wave spawner system that keeps players on their toes, ensuring an ever-intensifying experience.

The core mechanic revolves around an advanced auto-targeting aim, allowing players to focus on strategic maneuvering and precise timing rather than wrestling with manual targeting. This feature not only enhances the fluidity of combat but also highlights my ability to implement responsive and user-friendly controls in a 3D environment.

Engage in heart-pounding firefights as you navigate through intricately designed levels, each presenting new challenges and enemy types. Project MVC is not just a game; it's a testament to my expertise in creating immersive and visually stunning 3D action experiences within the Unity engine.
